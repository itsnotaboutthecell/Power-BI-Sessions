# Tabular Editor 2 In An Hour ![Tabular Editor](./Images/tabular_editor.png)


### About:
Tabular Editor provides an intuitive hierarchical view of every object in your Tabular Model metadata. Columns, Measures and Hierarchies are arranged in Display Folders by default. You can edit properties of one or more objects, by (multi)selecting them in the tree. A DAX Editor with syntax highlighting lets you easily edit the expressions of Measures, Calculated Columns and Calculated Tables.

Tabular Editor 2 (TE2) is the original open source version. This is free to use and will continue to be supported. 
Tabular Editor 3 (TE3) is the commercial product version. It has a 30 day trial afterwards a paid license is required. 
This introduction covers TE2, but the material translates to TE3.

# Setup

## Instructions
### [Optional: Guided Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFX20PPxXjs&list=PLKW7XPyNDgRCOiC69kZWfRQdOxcnQy2yA&index=2)

### Power BI Desktop
1. Ensure the Power BI preview feature [Store datasets using enhanced metadata format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-enhanced-dataset-metadata) is enabled.

### Tabular Editor
1. Navigate to the **File** menu and select **Preferences**
2. Enable the settings:
    1. **Allow unsupported Power BI features (experimental)**
    2. **Detect changes on local AS instance (experimental)**

![Tabular Editor Preferences](./Images/tabular_editor_preferences.png)

**Important Note:** Always create a backup of your PBIX file prior to editing to avoid any issues in the event of a corrupted model.


# Tabular Object Model Hierarchy
**Source:** Microsoft Docs

The Tabular Object Model (TOM) exposes native tabular metadata, such as model, tables, columns, and relationships objects. A high-level view of the object model tree, provided below, illustrates how the component parts are related.

![Tabular Object Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/tom/media/ssastomobjectmodeldiagram.png "Tabular Object Model")

From a logical perspective, all tabular objects form a tree, the root of which is a Model, descended from Database. Server and Database are not considered tabular because these objects can also represent a multidimensional database hosted on a server running in Multidimensional mode, or a tabular model at a lower compatibility level that does not use tabular metadata for object definitions.

### Objective: Extract the underlying metadata from the model.

## Instructions
### [Optional: Guided Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFz-NaGXZ4w&list=PLKW7XPyNDgRCOiC69kZWfRQdOxcnQy2yA&index=3)
1. Open the Sales Demo (PBIX) file, navigate to the **External Tools** ribbon in Power BI Desktop and select **Tabular Editor**.
2. On your local machine create a folder titled: **Sales Demo**
3. Within Tabular Editor 
    1. Navigate to **File > Save to Folder...** and select the above **Sales Demo** that was created.
    2. Navigate to the **Sales Demo** folder and review the outputs in comparison with the TOM hierarchy above.
4. To view the full solution navigate to **File > Save As..** and save the output **model.bim** (bim: business intelligence model), to your local machine to review.

**Important Note:** The underlying **model.bim** file can now be incorporated into your CI/CD pipelines for deployments with Azure DevOps. To deploy changes directly to existing datasets published in the Power BI service, enabling the XMLA read/write endpoint in the capacity settings and Power BI Premium is required. Once changes have been made to a dataset published in the service using the XMLA end point, a PBIX file will no longer be able to be downloaded.

# Advanced Scripting (Automation)

Advanced Scripting, lets users write a script, to more directly manipulate the objects in the loaded Tabular Model, that can be saved as Custom Actions for easy invocation directly in the Explorer Tree.

Website: https://github.com/otykier/TabularEditor/wiki/Advanced-Scripting

**Important Note:** 
- You can use CTRL+Z to undo or CTRL+Y to redo changes.
- The scripting language is C#

### Objective: Create a script to automate the addition of measures in the model.
